\description{
Abstract \code{Terminator} class that implements the base functionality each
terminator must provide. A terminator is an object that determines when to
stop the optimization.

Termination of optimization works as follows: * Evaluations in a instance are
performed in batches. * Before each batch evaluation, the \link{Terminator} is
checked, and if it is positive, we stop. * The optimization algorithm itself
might decide not to produce any more points, or even might decide to do a
smaller batch in its last evaluation.

Therefore the following note seems in order: While it is definitely possible
to execute a fine-grained control for termination, and for many optimization
algorithms we can specify exactly when to stop, it might happen that too few
or even too many evaluations are performed, especially if multiple points are
evaluated in a single batch (c.f. batch size parameter of many optimization
algorithms). So it is advised to check the size of the returned archive, in
particular if you are benchmarking multiple optimization algorithms.

Creates a new instance of this \link[R6:R6Class]{R6} class.

Helper for print outputs.

Printer.

Is \code{TRUE} iff the termination criterion is positive, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
Must be implemented in each subclass.
